	<title>Special extra/mini buttons</title>

	<p>Using the specbuttons plugin, you can define additional
	shortcuts. This is meant as convenience - allows to start
	other audio apps or system controls from within streamtuner2.</p>

	<p><media type="image" src="img/specbuttons.png"></media></p>
	
	<p>The settings list can be found with the plugin options in the
	<key>ðŸ”Œ Features</key> tab.  It follows the layout of the player/recording
	configuration.  Except that it lists icons and their according
	action commands:</p>

	<table shade="rows" rules="rows cols">
		<tr><td><p><em>Icon</em></p></td>  	        <td><p><em>Cmd</em></p></td> </tr>
		<tr><td><p><app>volume-up</app></p></td>        <td><p><cmd>amixer sset Master 2%+</cmd></p></td> </tr>
		<tr><td><p><app>gtk-media-forward</app></p></td><td><p><cmd>vlc next</cmd></p></td> </tr>
		<tr><td><p><app>mixer</app></p></td>		<td><p><cmd>pavucontrol</cmd></p></td> </tr>
		<tr><td><p><app>database</app></p></td>		<td><p><cmd>./myscript "%url" "%title"</cmd></p></td> </tr>
		<tr><td><p><app>./import.png</app></p></td>	<td><p><cmd>audacity %pls</cmd></p></td> </tr>
	</table>

        <section id="gtk-icons">
        <title>gtk-icons</title>
	<p>Note that the icon name can also be that of a Gtk-builtin icon. Their
        names always start with "<app>gtk-</app>" - for example "<app>gtk-cancel</app>". You can
        find a list of all available builtins under
        <link href="http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/gtk-stock-items.html">http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/gtk-stock-items.html</link>.
        They usually match your Gtk theme though.</p>
	</section>
	
        <section id="png-icons">
        <title>PNG icons</title>
	<p>In case you enter something like "<app>player</app>", the icon name will be
	searched for and expanded to an absolute PNG filename. For example
        "<file>totem</file>" might become <file>/usr/share/icons/HighContrast/16x16/apps/totem.png</file>.</p>
        
        <p>This won't always yield the exact icon / theme / or size you wanted. So it's
	sometimes necessary to look up the complete path yourself.
	So you might want search them manually <cmd>locate /usr/shar/icons |
	grep "volume"</cmd> to pick out a more fitting icon.</p>
	
	<p>You can also use png files located in your homedir or else.</p>
	</section>

        <section id="placeholders">
        <title>Commands</title>
        <p>You can define any graphical or commandline application to be
        invoked by your custom toolbar button. Foremost you want to invoke
        audio controls of course, or start/stop players.</p>
        
        <p>For example <cmd>amixer sset Master 1dB+</cmd> is likely to work
        for all current distributions.</p>
        
	<p>Placeholders like %title and %url or %pls and %m3u are supported
	for all commands as well. So you can have additional play/record
	shortcuts.</p>
	</section>

        <section id="icon-rows">
        <title>icon rows</title>
	<p>With the "number of rows" setting, more buttons can be packed together.
	It looks okay with up to 3 rows - when using the large sized main toolbar.
	The defined icon shortcuts will always be packed column-wise.</p>

        <note style="bug"><p>The icon list isn't ordered. So you cannot
        define which button appears first. (Albeit the plugin config
        definition can be changed from 'dict' to 'table' now, and the plugin
        required just a little editing then.)</p></note>
