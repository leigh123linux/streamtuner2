	<title>Edit</title>

	<p>You probably don't often need this. But there's an
	<guiseq><gui></gui> <gui>Edit/Details</gui></guiseq> context menu
	which brings up a station editor:
	</p>
	
	<media type="image" src="img/streamedit.png" mime="image/png" />

	<p>You can see the standard title and genre fields here. But also a
	few internally kept infos. For example the "url" field contains the
	actual pls/m3u/server address. While the "format" can list a
	non-standard audio compression type.</p>

	<note>
	<p>This dialog is primarily useful for your personal bookmarks.
	It allows to shorten or rename things. You can even use
	<gui style="button">new</gui> to add new entries this way.
	(Which doesn't make sense in regular channel categories, because
	changes will be lost once you hit Reload.)</p>
