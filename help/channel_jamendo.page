<title>Jamendo</title>

<p>Jamendo is a Creative Comments licensing oriented music distributor. It hosts audio
files for individual musicians and artists. Tracks and albums can thus be downloaded
free of charge. Yeah, imagine that.</p>

<p>The new Jamendo v3.0 is now utilized. It allows to list albums,
playlists, and individual tracks by genre.  The radio list is static
(they're looping over randomized songs from each genre.)</p>

<p>Instead of favicons, streamtuner2 can fetch album or track
covers.  Thus the images are a bit larger, and retrieving them all
via <guiseq><gui>Channel</gui> <gui>Load favicons...</gui></guiseq>
takes a while longer.</p>

     <title>Streaming format</title>
     <p>You can switch between MP3 and Ogg Vorbis audio streams for Jamendo.
     It's not honored by the radio section, but albums and tracks should be
     received as Ogg when configured so.</p>

     <title>Preview image sizes</title>
     <p>Album covers are downloaded in lieu of favicons. They're available
     in different sizes. Use 25px if you want just favicon-sized icons.</p>
