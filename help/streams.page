	<title>Streams / Stations</title>

	<p>Radio stations are listed in the right pane. Usually they have a title and a
        description. The description is often the last played song. (This isn't updated
        automatically to conserve bandwidth and because live information is seldomly available.)</p>

        <p>You can double click a station line to get it to play. Alternatively there are the
        play and record buttons in the menubar. You can also invoke a stations homepage, if it
        has one.</p>
