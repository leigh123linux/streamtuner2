	<title>Reloading</title>
        <p>Station information can get stale. Especially Shoutcast invalidates old information
        frequently. Therefore you have to [Reload] the lists. There is an action button below
        the menu bar for this. It retrieves the current data from the directory service.</p>

	<p>Favicons aren't loaded automatically. There is a menu entry in Channels for that, which
        works in the background and doesn't display the new icons automatically either. Simply
        reselect the category/genre in the left pane. Or again, use the station reload button.</p>
