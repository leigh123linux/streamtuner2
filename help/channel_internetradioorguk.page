	<title>Internet-Radio.com</title>

	<p>I-R.com is a good alternative to Shoutcast. It also lacks a channel homepage in most
	cases, but is a likewise encyclopedical directory. Genres are similiar to Shoutcast.</p>

	<note><p>Note that this plugin uses its own setting for how many links to retrieve. Instead
	of stream numbers, it only counts pages (which however speeds up processing now).</p></note>
