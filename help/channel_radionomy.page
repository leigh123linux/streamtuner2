	<p>Radionomy is an internet radio streaming provider, orginally
	founded in Belgium.  It commands a pretty big slice of the worldwide
	internet radio stuff these days. - It took over Shoutcast.com for
	instance.</p>

	<p>Their primary directory on Radionomy.com only lists stations
	which radionomy itself hosts streaming servers for.  It's over 6000
	already.  Both listening and station hosting are free (given agreement
	to autoplay advertisements, and a minimum quota of daily listeners). 
	Radionomy is therefore pretty popular and growing.</p>
	
	<p>The extraction method in streamtuner2 uses a mix of RegExp,
	DOM traversal, and JSON extraction, with some AJAX updating spiced
	in. It closely follows the website scheme to fetch station lists.
	Instead of favicons smaller station logos are displayed (25px
	in contrast to the usual 16px).

         <p> You can configure the number of pages it'll try (<key>3</key> by
  	 default) to influence the length of station lists.</p>
	
	 <p> And the song title updating ("<key>OnAir Updates</key>") can be disabled.
	 Future versions of this channel plugin might poll it automatically,
	 and keep the station list auto-updated.</p>
