	<title>Searching</title>

	<p>There are two search functions.</p>


	<section id="quicksearch">
	<title>Quick search</title>
        <p>Just enter text into the quick search box atop. Streamtuner2 will instantly highlight
	any matches in the current stations view. If you switch tabs, just click the glass icon
	to reapply the highlighting.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="cachesearch">
	<title>Search window</title>

	<p>You can get to the search dialog via <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui>
	<gui>Find</gui></guiseq> or <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>F</key>.  Centrally
	to this dialog is the text field, where you can specify the phrase
	to scan for.</p>

	<media src="img/search.png" type="image" mime="image/png" />

        <p>It either will search in all channels, or just the last active
        channel/service.</p>

	<p>Then there are two search variants.  You mostly want to use
        the live <gui>Server search</gui>.  It passes your search terms to
        the actual directory services, and loads the most recent data into a
        result list. This might take a few seconds. And it's not implemented
        for all channel plugins. (Some websites/APIs don't have a search.)</p>

	<p>While <gui>Cache find</gui> would just look up entries in your
        already downloaded channel/genre lists.  This is sufficient when
        you're just looking for something previously seen/listened to.</p>
