<section id="apps">

    <title>Player application settings</title>

    <p>MIME types are categorzied identifiers for file types. <var>Audio/mpeg</var> for example represents MP3 files,
    and <var>audio/ogg</var> means just OGG. And the player setting dialog simply associates an audio type with a
    playback application:</p>

<table shade="rows" rules="rows cols">
  <thead>  <tr><td><p>Format</p></td>     <td><p>Application</p></td></tr> </thead>
    <tr><td><p><var>audio/mpeg</var></p></td>     <td><p><cmd>audacious</cmd></p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p><var>audio/ogg</var></p></td>      <td><p><cmd>audacious</cmd></p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p><var>audio/*</var></p></td>        <td><p><cmd>vlc --one-instance</cmd></p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p><var>video/*</var></p></td>        <td><p><cmd>totem</cmd></p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p><var>video/youtube</var></p></td>  <td><p><cmd>vlc %srv</cmd></p></td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Application names are always lowercase binary names. Double click an entry to edit it.</p>

    <p>After the application name, you can use a placeholder like "<var>%pls</var>" (default),
    or "<var>%m3u</var>" and "<var>%src</var>". See <link xref="config_apps#placeholders">placeholders</link>.</p>

    <p>Catch-all entries like <var>*/*</var> or a generic <var>audio/*</var> entry allow to configure a default player.
    While <var>video/youtube</var> is specific to the Youtube channel. And <var>url/http</var> a psdeudo MIME type
    to configure a web browser (for station homepages).</p>

</section>
<section id="recording">

    <title>Recording Apps</title>

    <p>The second block of entries in the 'Apps' section specifies recording applications.
    Here streamripper is preconfigured for audio streams, and youtube-dl for Youtube videos for instance.</p>

<table shade="rows" rules="rows cols">
    <tr><td><p><var>audio/*</var></p></td>         <td><p><cmd>xterm -e streamripper %srv</cmd></p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p><var>video/youtube</var></p></td>   <td><p><cmd>xterm -e "youtube-dl %srv"</cmd></p></td></tr>
</table>

    <p>To define a target directory, you can add commandline arguments to each. Also it's typically
    helpful to leave the xterm prefix on, so you can follow the processing state. (Alternatively to
    xterm there is x-terminal-emulator, or rxvt, gnome-terminal, xfce4-terminal, etc.)</p>

<section id="gui">

  <title>Display/GUI options</title>
  <terms>
    <title>Display settings</title>
    <item>
      <title>Display favicons</title>
      <p>The options for the favicons define if station entries should show little icons.
      Not all stations have one, so you might as well turn this off to conserve a little memory.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Load favicons</title>
      <p>When starting to play a station, its homepage favicon is automatically retrieved in the
      background. It's not going to be displayed right away, but after you reload the category/station list.
      Alternatively use <guiseq><gui>Channel</gui> <gui>Update favicons...</gui></guiseq> to update all
      station icons at once.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Show bookmark star</title>
      <p>Bookmarked stations will be marked with a â˜… star in all other station lists / categories.
      That doesn't often work for the same station entry from two different channel services / tabs though.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Gtk+ theme</title>
      <p>Be careful. While Gtk allows to select a different theme per application, not all themes
      work right away. Switching the theme might hang streamtuner2. Just restart if that happens.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Save window states</title>
      <p>Automatically remember window size, selected channel tab, categories, or selected station.
      Also keeps the width of station list columns. If disabled, you can manually save the current
      layout/selections via <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui> <gui>Save States</gui></guiseq>.</p>

    <title>Station loading</title>
    <item>
      <title>Prefer HTML traversing (PyQuery) over regex</title>
      <p>Some channels provide proper APIs to fetch station lists. Others are just websites, that
      require scraping listings out. Most channel tabs provide two alternative methods for that.
      The DOM/HTML selection method is sometimes more reliable. As fallback streamtuner2 plugins
      often use a regex to match text. Occassionally the regex method is actually more reliable,
      because directory services often use frightful unstructured HTML. If available, both methods
      are tried. You can influence the order with this setting.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>[<input>250</input>] Limit stream number</title>
      <p> Constraints the length of station lists per category.
      The number of stations setting is not honored by all channel plugins. Often it's not possible to
      load more or fewer station entries. Some plugins have own settings (in the 'Plugins' section) even.
      For the major plugins this however limits how much scroll text appears in the stream lists.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Retain deleted stations</title> <p>When enabled, keeps old station entries when
      updating/reloading a category/genre.  Services often forget stations or throws them out when inavailable.
      With this option enabled, these entries are kept in streamtuner2 as strikethrough entries (often
      at the end of the list).</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Update favouries from freshened URLs</title>
      <p>Streaming URLs in bookmarked stations get renewed on category reloads/updates. This isn't
      very reliable, as often station titles change together with the streaming URLs.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>google station homepages</title>
      <p>When playing a station that doesn't have a homepage entry, streamtuner2 tries to google
      the station title. The found URL is then used/kept as station homepage. (Btw, station titles
      like www.mymusicstation.com are automatically mapped to homepage URLs already.)</p>
    </item>

  <terms>
    <title>System</title>
    <item>
      <title>Temporary files</title>
      <p>Streamtuner2 creates temporary .m3u files, if an audio player is configured to use %m3u files
      instead of %pls or %srv URLs. For archival purposes, you might want to set a dedicated directory
      for this. Leave this to the default /tmp else.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Config directory</title>
      <p>Is where streamtuner2 keeps its settings.json and channel caches, favicons, etc.
      You can't set this in the config dialog. This is just for display. Set the XDG_CONFIG_HOME
      environment variable to adapt.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Enable debug messages</title>
      <p>If you start streamtuner2 from a terminal window (xterm/rxvt), you can get a load of state
      and processing or debug infos. Enable this only for testing, as it might slow down station
      rendering.</p>
    </item>

<section id="plugins">
    <title>Plugin and Channel settings</title>

    <p>This tab lists all available channel and feature plugins. Mark checkboxes for those plugins
    you want to enable. You have to restart Streamtuner2 for any changes here to take effect.</p>

    <p>Each channel plugin may come with its own set of addition configuration settings
    below.</p>

    <p>If you want to find out more about the short option descriptions (most settings are checkboxes),
    please have a look into the channels directory /usr/share/streamtuner2/channels/ and corresponding
    *.py files. These are readable, and sometimes contain more information.</p>
