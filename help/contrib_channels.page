    <title><link href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</link></title>
    <p>Reddit is a social media site. Among its various sections is a large
    /r/Music subreddit group. Most of them link popular or novel Youtube
    music videos, or user-produced content etc. Radioreddit.com even provides
    streaming servers. This plugin can also list Soundcloud/Mixcloud/Bandcamp
    links. But those would require a custom audio player. There's an extra
    Soundcloud plugin however, which makes those streams readily playble.</p>

    <title><link href="http://di.fm/">Di.fm</link></title>
    <p>"Digitally Imported" are mostly electronic music radio stations.
    The freely available stations stream with 64kbit/s AAC+ only.</p>
  </item>

    <title><link href="http://radio.net/">Radio.net</link></title>
    <p>Radio.net is a European radio directory. It nicely catalogues
    stations into genres as usual. The primary list is ordered by
    popularity even. </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><link href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</link></title>
    <p>Magnatune is an independent label for artists. It makes most
    albums available for free listening with only a few intermittent
    adverts. Otherwise it's a flatrate payable music discovery and
    download service. </p>

    <title><link href="http://publicradiofan.com/">PublicRadioFan</link></title>
    <p>PublicRadioFan.com hosts a huge lists of worldwide radio stations.
    This plugin displays just the genre list though.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><link href="http://windowsmedia.com/">WindowsMedia</link></title>
    <p>Is actually a Windows-specific streaming directory. Station entries
    are converted from ASX into standard playlist formats by ST2. </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><link href="http://delicast.com/">Delicast</link></title>
    <p>Delicast.com is another web directory of radio stations. It's
    somewhat slower because playback addresses are hidden away with extra
    page requests. Works reliably still. </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><link href="http://listenlive.eu/">ListenLive.eu</link></title>
    <p>ListenLive is also an Europe-centric radio directory. </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><link href="http://punkcast.com/">PunkCast</link></title>
    <p>PunkCast is no longer maintained. It covered the NY music and tech
    scenes, but existing recordings are still accessible mostly (some are
    just weblinks howeever). This plugin is kept for nostalgic reasons;
    it was available with streamtuner1 as well. </p>
  </item>

    <title><p>GrLittleRadioPlayer</p></title>
    <p>Great Little Radio Player is another Linux desktop radio browser.
    It comes with a default set of categorized stations. This plugin merely
    imports that list as static directory. </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><p>Compound</p></title>
    <p>The compound channel is a meta plugin. It can aggregate categories
    from other channel plugins on a per-category basis. You for example
    can mash Top40 or Classic genres from Shoutcast, Xiph, InternetRadio,
    Tunein, etc. Which avoids switching between channel tabs somewhat. </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><p>File browser</p></title>
    <p>You can also browser local files with streamtuner2 using the file
    browser plugin. It must be configured with your music collection path.
    It's not a default plugin, because this isn't really what Streamtuner2
    is made for. There are way better local music collection managers for
    Linux. It's just here for convenience, and displays files just as any
    other channel list. It has no specific file management features, and
    won't get any. </p>
