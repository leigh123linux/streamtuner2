	<title>Timer</title>

<section>
	<p>You can programm play/recording events with the timer plugin. Simply select a station
	and choose <guiseq><gui>Station</gui> <gui>Extensions</gui> <gui>Add timer...</gui></guiseq>.
	A small popup will ask for a data/time string. If you press <key>OK</key> the station
	and the programmed time will be stored in the bookmarks channel in the "timer" category.</p>

        <note style="tip"><p>Note that streamtuner2 must be running for the programmed timer events to work.
	(In a future version there might be the option to have it handled by the system cron
	daemon.)</p></note>

	<title>Time specification strings</title>
	<p>The time and date specificators follow a simple scheme. It's always one or more day names
	followed by a clock range, and finally the action.</p>
	<p>For example "<code>Mon,Tue,Wed</code>" will make the event occour on the first
	three days of each week, while just "Fri" would limit it to Fridays.</p>
	<p>A clock range of "<code>18:00-20:00</code>"
	would start the event at 18 o'clock and last it two hours. Note that for "play" events, the end
	time is irrelevant, since streamtuner2 can't kill your audio player anyway.</p>
        <p>The end time is only important, if you replace "play" with the word "<code>record</code>"
        in the timer event string. This runs streamripper instead and limits the recording time.</p>

	<section id="editing">
	<title>Editing events</title>
        <p>You can remove entries from the "timer" list again. Use the normal <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui> <gui>Delete</gui></guiseq> for
	that. It's also possible to modify the date+time strings by editing the stream info and
	the specification in the "playing" field.</p>

	<note style="warning"><p>However, such changes don't take effect until you restart streamtuner2. The timer
	events are only scheduled when adding a new event, or on starting streamtuner2.</p></note>
