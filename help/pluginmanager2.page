	<title>Plugin Manager 2</title>

	<p>For updating or installing new plugins (extra channels or
	features), there's a user plugin manager. It's available as
	feature extension itself.</p>
	
	<p>Once acticated (after a restart) it brings up a new <key>ðŸ“¦
	Add</key> tab in the configuration window.</p>
	
	<p><media type="image" src="img/pluginmanager2.png"
	mime="image/png">Install dialog for user plugins</media></p>
	
	<p>You can scan for available/new plugins there. And have them
	downloaded right away. New plugins are just downloaded, not
	implictly enabled. Reopen the config dialog to see them in the
	regular <key>ðŸ“» Channels</key> or <key>ðŸ”Œ Feature</key> tabs, and
	then enable them.</p>

	of changed plugin states.</p>

	  <item><p>After reconfiguring existing channel plugins, they get
   	  automatically instantiated or disabled in the user interface.
   	  (Which avoids the usual restart).</p></item>
	  <item><p>This currently doesn't work with feature/core
   	  plugins. Plugin deactivation is mostly visual, but does not undo
   	  menu extensions or undefine callback hooks.</p></item>

	<p>Downloaded plugins are stored in <file>~/.config/streamtuner2/plugins</file>.
	To remove them, delete the individual *.py files there manually.</p>
	<note style="bug"><p>Currently system-installed core plugins take
	precedence over downloaded updates.</p>
	<p>And you'll have to take care to eventually refresh/delete outdated user plugins,
	whenever you install a newer Streamtuner2 version.</p></note>
