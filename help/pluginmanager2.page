	<title>Plugin Manager 2</title>

	<p>As of release 2.1.8 there is a plugin manager. It's available as
	feature extension. Once acticated (after a restart) it brings up a
	new <gui>ðŸ“¦ Add</gui> tab in the configuration window.</p>
	
	<p><media type="image" src="img/pluginmanager2.png"
	mime="image/png">Install dialog for user plugins</media></p>
	
	<p>You can scan for available/new plugins there. And have them
	downloaded right away. New plugins are just downloaded, not
	implictly enabled. Reopen the config dialog to see them in the
	regular lists.</p>
	
	<section id="configuration">
	<title>Configuration</title>
	<p>Alternative download repositories may be configured. (Little
	practical value at the moment and foreseeable future.)</p>
	<p>And you can let the plugin manager handle regular plugins as
	well. After reconfiguring existing channel plugins, they get
	automatically run, or disabled in the user interface (without
	any restart). Which won't work for most feature/core plugins.</p>
