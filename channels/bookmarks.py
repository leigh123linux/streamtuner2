# This module lists static content from ~/.config/streamtuner2/bookmarks.json.
# Any bookmarked station will appear with a star â˜… icon in other channels.
#
# Some feature extensions inject custom subcategories here. For example the
# "search" feature adds its own result list here, as does the "timer" plugin.

# The bookmarks tab is a core feature and built into the GtkBuilder
# layout. Which is why it derives from GenericChannel, and requires
# less setup.
#
# Furthermore it pretty much only handles a static streams{} list.
# Sub-plugins simply append a new category, and populate the streams
# list themselves.
#
# It's accessible as `main.bookmarks` in the ST2 window and elsewhere.
