It utilizes various directory services like Shoutcast, Xiph, InternetRadio, SurfMusik, MyOggRadio, iCast, or Jamendo and Youtube to present categorized streaming stations. It chains to installed audio players like Audacious or VLC, uses streamripper for recording, but also allows bookmarking, exporting and easy searching.",

            "changes": "New channel plugins for Radionomy.com, Filtermusic.net, Delicast.com. Added Dirble channel again, using new API. Removed iCast plugin. Removed 8tracks plugin. Brought back Xiph XML extraction, and added direct website extraction, in addition to JSON cache mode. Add TV list for UbuntuUsers channel. Introduction of User Plugin Manager and channel module updating, automatic plugin activation, contrib plugins: PublicRadioFan, GLRP. Change Youtube plugin to use only v3 API henceforth. Minor fixes to action/playlist extraction, add specific JAMJ extractor. Update manual on new channel/feature plugins. Separated config and pluginconf modules. Fixes to contrib/ plugins: compound, file, punkcast. Scroll back to last category on initialization, simplified window and state storage. Some Gtk3 fixes, catch invalid favicons while updating columns, another fix for search function. Better inline documentation for player configuration, more thorough program binary detection. Simplified channel parsing utility code, added @use_rx decorator. And a few more internal cleanups. Add new configuration dialog group for Playlist processing. Experimental new package for Arch Linux / pacman.",

            "changes": "Experimental support for drag and drop, which allows playback, importing, or exporting stations from/to files.  Configuration dialog became more clearly arranged by separating channels and feature plugins.  More manual examples on recording configuration added.  Several enhancements to playlist conversion, support for .desktop links, better heuristics, and working url+title extraction.  All MOD files use generic audio/mod+zip MIME type. Use new and distinct /tmp/streamtuner2/ directory for cache+export. Implemented hashing for cached m3u/pls files.  Support 'feeds' stream in Jamendo, more complete Ogg Vorbis support and JAMJSON extraction instead of using old v2 API.  Initial startup and application state restoration became more robust, active category is tracked more dynamically.  Some internal simplifications and code cleanup (logging simplified, more uikit wrappers for Gtk3, removed outdated PIL workaround, cleanup up remnant module descriptions).  Statusbar is just a plain text label, automatically emptied. Disable partial stream refreshing, and threading per --nt flag or config option, because Gtk3 support is still flaky.  Let gtk_idle callbacks run in order through an internal precedence spool.  Browser invocations corrected. Crash in cache search fixed.  PYZ building now supported by xpm and Packfile for custom adaptions.",

Along with that a category playlist export function was bundled, and the Save-As dialog reworked. A new SomaFM channel was bundled, and user agent switcher plugin added. Fixes for the bookmarks channel, cache search, plugin lookup code were applied. Startup is faster again, but plugins now initialize on selection first. Which makes the category association exacter after restarts. More code cleanup and restructuring, GUI updates, command line flag handling. Still a beta release.",

            "changes": "This is a beta release, with lots of cleanups and various bugfixes. Adds a self-contained PYZ package, which Python can run directly. Now fully utilizes the plugin meta data scheme for default settings, discovery, and to reduce internal complexity. A new channel plugin for Radio-Browser.info has been bundled. Another plugin for interfacing with RadioTray was introduced, to share bookmarks via DBUS once RadioTray implements it. Notebook tabs are now on the left per default, and can be rearranged directly in the GUI. The configuration dialog now indicates the availability of selected audio players. Default audio players are now automatically configured during the first startup. Gtk properties are now utilized more over internal UI state vars. The the GtkBuilder UI file is now compressed, the Gtk2 fallback removed. The former channel icon PNGs are now embedded. Theme configuration was removed. Category retrieval became more resilient. HTTP timeouts have been added. The bookmarks tab, settings window, search dialog, stream inspector/editor have been externalized into plugins; yet remain core features. The packaging layout has been slightly restructured - to support relocatable installations (for PyZIP package). Minor fixes to youtube, internet_radio, punkcast, timer and other plugins. Help pages have been updated further, as well as CREDITS, README and general PACKAGING infos, and most plugin short descriptions. The project wiki now contains a more details on plugin APIs.",
