streamtuner2
============

ST2 is a internet radio browser. It queries online directories like
shoutcast and xiph.org for music stations.

It mimics the original streamtuner 1 to some extend. It's however
written in Python now instead of C.


installation howto
------------------

You can just execute the main binary "st2.py". All the other files
need to be copied into /usr/share/streamtuner2/ however. If it
doesn't work, make sure you have Python and gtk/pygtk installed:

  sudo apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-glade2 python-xdg

The gtk*.xml file represents the GUI.  So with glade installed, you
can inspect and adapt the interface.


alternatives
------------

* http://sourceforge.net/projects/radiotray/
* https://sites.google.com/site/glrpgreatlittleradioplayer/
* http://tunapie.sourceforge.net/
* VLC also has a few directory discovery services built-in
* Rythmbox comes with last.fm, libre.fm, radio lookups


Streamtuner2 CLI can also be used as proxy server for streamtuner1.
There is a wrapper available. But there was nobody yet to be found who
wanted it set up globally.
It's available as st1proxy.tgz and cli-mode-only.tgz from
http://milki.include-once.org/streamtuner2/ext/
Contact me for setup help. Requires a webserver with unrestrained
vhost support.
