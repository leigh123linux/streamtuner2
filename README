streamtuner2
============

ST2 is a internet radio browser. It queries online directories like
shoutcast and xiph.org for music stations.

It mimics the original streamtuner 1 to some extend. It's however
written in Python now instead of C.


Installation howto
------------------

If possible, prefer the package directly from your BSD/Linux distribution.
Due to an excessive maintenance break, some still have older 2.0.8 version
however - which barely works anymore.
If so, you should use a manually installed version.

Dependencies
------------

Running streamtuner2 requires Python and Gtk packages. Which nowadays are
installed per default. There's a few more Python packages required though:

 · python | python3
 · pygtk | python-gi
 · python-requests
 · python-pyquery
 · python-lxml
 · python-keybinder (optional)
 · python-xdg (optional)

Use your distro package manager with e.g.:

  sudo apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-xdg python-requests ...

Or utilize Pythons local package installer even:

  sudo pip install requests


DEB / RPM
---------

There are rudimentary packages built as .DEB and .RPM version. Install
those if feasible. The dependencies may not match with your package
manger, and are somewhat incomplete. (See "Dependencies" section.)


PYZ
---

Other users may wish to try the new Python archive (.PYZ) instead. Which
requires little installation, but can just be run in-place:

    python streamtuner-2.1.5.pyz

You could even make this Python ZIP executable, and copy it in your PATH.


Manual installation
-------------------

If you've checked out the source code repository, or did download the
*.src.txz archive, then you can just run it right there:

   ./st2.py

To install it manually:

  · Create a /usr/share/streamtuner2/
  · Copy all *.py files there.
  · Also copy the "gtk3.xml" file into /usr/share/streamtuner2/
  · Copy the channels/ subdir into /usr/share/streamtuner2/channels/
  · Install "bin" as /usr/bin/streamtuner2.
  · If you want to use another target, just edit the "bin" wrapper.
  · Optionally copy the help/ folder to /usr/share/docs/streamtuner2/
  · And the logo.png into the system pixmaps/,
    as well as the *.desktop file into /usr/share/applications/

That's pretty much what the binary packages extract to.


Hacking
-------

If you want to edit a channel plugin, just have a look into the
channels/*.py files. It's often rather easy to adapt things.

Moreover you can also edit the user interface. You need glade-3
installed, and open the "gtk3.xml" file. There it's easy to
rename or rearrange things.
