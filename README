streamtuner2
============

ST2 is a internet radio browser. It queries online directories like
shoutcast and xiph.org for music stations.

It mimics the original streamtuner 1 to some extend. It's however
written in Python now instead of C.


installation howto
------------------

You can just execute the main binary "st2.py".
All the other files need to be copied into /usr/share/streamtuner2/ however.
In particular the channel/ directory needs to reside there, so ST2 can find
all its plugins.

If it doesn't work, make sure you have Python and gtk/pygtk installed:

  sudo apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-glade2 python-xdg

And a few modules like:

  sudo apt-get install python-requests python-pyquery python-keybinder

You can also install Python modules per `pip` with

  sudo pip install requests

The gtk*.xml file represents the GUI, btw.  So with glade installed, you
can inspect and adapt the interface.
